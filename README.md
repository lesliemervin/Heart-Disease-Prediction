# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using multiple machine learning models. It leverages various classification algorithms to compare performance and improve prediction accuracy.


Models Implemented
Logistic Regression – A simple yet effective linear model for binary classification.

Naïve Bayes – A probabilistic model based on Bayes' Theorem, assuming feature independence.

Random Forest – An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees for robust predictions.

Decision Tree – A tree-based model that splits data based on feature conditions.

XGBoost – A powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for high performance in structured data.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) – A model that finds the optimal hyperplane to classify data points.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – A non-parametric model that classifies based on proximity to neighbors.

Neural Network – A deep learning approach that captures complex patterns in data.


Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various health-related attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other diagnostic measurements.


Performance Evaluation
Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are applied to optimize model performance.
